var parOne = "Hometown. City Beautiful. Most cherished and frequent journey, was home to school and back. Mostly a bus ride, but sometimes I would miss it on the way back and walk. Living here was experiencing the genious of Le-Corbusier in every moment of life. It is perhaps, one of the least understood peicce of architectural and planning marvel.";
var parTwo = "Loved engineering, but loved art and cuture more. So took up architecture at the finest school in the country. School of Planning and Architecture building at ITO, New Delhi became my second home. First home... Maharani Bagh Hostel obviously. Between these two were some of my weirdest journeys.";
var parThree = "Found my dream internship at this cool Design-n-Build firm in Puducherry in south India. No one in my family had lived that far south. New culture, new food, totally crazy language, but amazing, more civilized people. Worked my ass off making wooden furniture and renovating old French buildings. Journey was from a lovely studio appartment to the office/factory outside the old city and my bike made it all possible.";
var parFour = "Got married and moved to the India silicon valley of Bengaluru. Amazing city simply because the weather was super-amazing all the time. The weather would 'always' be good. Not sure how. But the journey was crazy long, but a new car with some nice music was all I needed to make it work. This city has been my favourite so far, not for what it is, but mostly for what I was in it.";
var parFive = "In Bengaluru, I worked with a firm where I was given charge of design and construction of this large mall in Thrissur, a city I had never been to. Obviously I took it up and had some fun. I would arrive every weekend at the Main Bus terminal and take an 'auto' to the site that was in the heart of this tiny city.";
var parSix = "Finally, after having learnt that architects don't really make good money, no matter how good you are, I decided to move on. City Planning at UPenn seemed like a good option. So took it up and it has been real crazy fun so far. Obviouly, jobs are a problem thanks to the new anti-immigrant crap all over this country but I am hopeful. Hope is a good thing and good things never go waste. My journey in this city has been mostly from my dorm to a cool, really cheap vegetable truck on the 44th Street and to the amazing Trader Joes. I love cycling and this city has loved me for doing so.";
